#### Can a Transformer learn a random transforer as the OBE does

No, the AM represented by a random transformer has an event horizon of infinity.(<- TODO proof. youse math snippes from previous section>) Transformers only have a a


#### A sparce Mixture of Transformers has an infinite horizon

Suppose bernoulli distributed $\theta$ describing am with horizon of one. then $\theta$ together with am would create series with infinite horizon
